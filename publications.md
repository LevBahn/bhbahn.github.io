    description: This paper deals with stochastic eigenvalue problem with power-type nonlinearity. The main goal is to show the theoretical guarantee of using quasi-Monte Carlo(QMC) method to approximate the expectation of the ground eigenpair of the stochastic problem. This paper is accepted by Communication in Mathematical Science and awaiting for the publication.
